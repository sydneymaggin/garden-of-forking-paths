            ... and I hung up the phone.
            Before the sun set on this same day, I ran the same risk.
            was I to die now? 
            Then I reflected that all things happen, happen to one, precisely now.
            Vaguely I thought that a pistol shot can be heard for a great distance. 
            In ten minutes I had developed my plan. 
            Silently, I dressed, took leave of myself in the mirror, went down the stairs, sneaked a look at the quiet street, and went out.
            I got out with a painful and deliberate slowness. 
            There was almost no one on the platform.
        <a href="p18.html">
            At last the train pulled out. 
        </a>
            From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject happiness.
            I argued that so small a victory prefigured a total victory.
            From my weakness I drew strength that never left me. 
            The train crept along gently, amid ash trees.
            He spent thirteen years on these oddly assorted tasks before he was assassinated by a stranger. 
            Lost in these imaginary illusions I forgot my destiny - that of the hunted.
            Two things dawned on me at once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible: the music came from the pavilion and that music was Chinese. 
            There was about him something of the priest, and something of the sailor.
            "A strange destiny," 
             I remember the final words, repeated at the end of each version like a secret command
            “Time is forever dividing itself toward innumerable futures and in one of them I am your enemy”
             In the black and yellow garden there was only a single man, but this man was as strong as a statue and this man was walking up the path and he was Captain Richard Madden.
            I fired with the utmost care
